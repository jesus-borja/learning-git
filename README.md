# Demo repository (also a private one)

This is suposed to be a description for the project.
It's also important to say that this README.md file is used in Github to show information about the repository :)

## Now locally from linux

I'm continuing with the crash course of git & github. Thanks FreeCodeCamp.org and Nico from youtube.com/c/HolaMundoDev :)

## git status 

This command help us know wich files have been created, but aren't tracked by git yet, wich ones have been modified or deleted

## git add .

This is often used to tell git to track all the files in a specified directory (more specifically in the directory where it was called).

### git add <filename>

We can alse use git add to add a single file to the stage, where they are waiting to be confirmed.

## git commit -m "Commit title" -m "Commit description"

The first "-m" is used to give a message about the commit, ideally it is related to the why we're making a commit.
We're forced to provide a title for commiting a change.
The second "-m" is used to provide a better description of what the commit does.
